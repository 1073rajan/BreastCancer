## BreastCancer Prediction Using Machine Learning.

## Introduction
Breast cancer is a prevalent disease affecting millions of women worldwide. 
Early detection and accurate diagnosis are crucial for improving patient outcomes. 
This project aims to develop a machine learning model that predicts breast cancer based on clinical and imaging data.

## Dataset
The dataset used for this project is the Breast Cancer Wisconsin (Diagnostic) dataset, sourced from the UCI Machine Learning Repository.
It contains features computed from digitized images of fine needle aspirates (FNA) of breast masses. 
The features include various measures of cell nuclei characteristics such as radius, texture, perimeter, area, smoothness, compactness, concavity, symmetry, and fractal dimension.

## Methodology
- Data Preprocessing: Cleaning the dataset, handling missing values, and scaling features.
- Feature Selection: Identifying relevant features to include in the model.
- Model Selection: Evaluating various machine learning algorithms (e.g., Logistic Regression, Random Forest, SVM) and selecting the best-performing one.
- Model Training: Training the selected model on the preprocessed dataset.
- Model Evaluation: Assessing the model's performance using appropriate evaluation metrics (e.g., accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score).
- Hyperparameter Tuning: Fine-tuning model parameters to improve performance.
